        You might wonder why has this place been named as Chappan Dukan, which literally means 56 shops !! Originally, when the market started, there were actually 56 shops here and thus the name !! However, as time passed by, some of the retailers sold their shops to the ones next-door, who wanted to make their shops bigger !! Even today, if you count the number of pillars between the shops, you'll actually see that there are exactly 56 shops !! 
        
        Now, the foodie & convenience market is not confined to just these shops on the main street, but has also extended in the area behind and around these original shops - the whole area being called as Chappan Dukan (56 Shops)</p>
